# UFO-HW

raytracing and raymarching project based on https://github.com/szecsi/WebGLMath

raytracer visualizes quadratic surfaces with different lighting calculations

raymarcher dipslays a volumetric data with different shading modes
These include
* matcap
* surface level with self shadow and phong shading
* volumetric attenuation/source (gas like medium)
* onion-layer-like display
